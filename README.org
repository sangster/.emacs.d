** About

After using vi for many, many years, I've decided to give emacs a try
for a while. This repository will contain my evolving editor init
files as I learn more about emacs. Feel free to use what you like.

It is based off the excellent [[https://github.com/technomancy/Emacs-starter-kit][starter-kit]] project.
